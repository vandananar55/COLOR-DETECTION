### Project Description 

In this project, there is one electric circuit image from which red coloured lines are being detected.

- Initially when we upload the image, we get the image in BGR format.
- To get the original colours of the image, the image is being converted to RGB format. 
- Further,to detect the particular or required colour from the image, hsv range is being setup (after conversion from rgb to hsv)

##### Note
Replace the image path after cloning the project according to the path of image of local system.
